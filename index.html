            <h2>I just wanted to say</h2>
            <p>To the love of my life, i want to take this opportunity to declare my deepest feelings and commitment to our relationship. From the moment we met, i had no idea, but i had met my future, and over the past three months, my love for you has only grown stronger. You light up my world, make me laugh, and support me in every way and i love that deep connection we have. I promise to be your rock, your partner, and your best friend forever. I vow to stand by your side through all of life's ups and downs, and to build a future filled with love. I love you more than words can express amor, and i am so grateful to have you by my side. Alana, though the distance between us may seem like an eternity, I am willing to wait patiently for the day when we can meet in person. Every moment, every day, and every night, my heart beats with anticipation, longing for the chance to hold your hand, to look into your eyes, and to feel your touch. I know that time is a healer, and with each passing day, my love for you only grows stronger. Until that day, know that you are always on my mind and in my heart. </p>
